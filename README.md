# Comparison_Classifiers

We are doing a comparison on various classifiers in terms of their performance for a given dataset. The comparison is concluded by determining the accuracy and sensitivity values for each of the model used. The final score is given by an Objective Value taking into account both the parameters. 

We use the [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) for the project. 

The following models are compared:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. Decision Tree
4. Gradient Boost Classifier
5. K Nearest Neighbours
6. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
7. Random Forest Classifier
8. Support Vector Machine
